# Script-Vault 
Script-Vault is a collection of Python scripts that I’ve created to explore and secure the digital landscape. This repository showcases my journey in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and network analysis. Each script is a unique tool that reflects my commitment to learning and my passion for tackling the challenges in the field of cybersecurity. I hope you find these scripts helpful and inspiring!

##  Overview of Script-Vault
Script-Vault is a carefully curated set of network security tools. Developed while mastering Python scripting and cybersecurity principles, these scripts serve as practical experiments, offering insights into the foundational aspects of ethical hacking. This repository is both a testament to my growth as a programmer and a functional toolkit for those eager to investigate network vulnerabilities.

##  Included Scripts
Here’s a summary of the tools currently housed within the vault, with many more on the way:

#### 1. MAC Address Changer 

#### Purpose Statement
The MAC Changer script allows users to easily change their device's MAC address either by entering a custom address or generating a random one. It provides options for automatic MAC address randomization at specified intervals, enhancing user privacy and network security.

#### Key Features
- Custom MAC Address Input: Users can specify a custom MAC address in the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
- Random MAC Generation: Automatically generate a random MAC address with a customizable prefix.
- Auto-Randomization: Change the MAC address at user-defined intervals, with options for seconds or minutes.
- Verification: Checks if the MAC address has been successfully changed and provides feedback.
- Reversion: Easily revert to the original MAC address when desired.

## Documentation
Each script includes its own README.md to explain its purpose, features, and step-by-step usage.
